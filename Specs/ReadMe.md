# CPSC1517 Project Specs

> ***StarTED*** Database - A simple database for a post-secondary school. Follow the [Database Installation Instructions](./Database/ReadMe.md) to set up **Star-TED** on your computer.

## Overview

This document outlines the marking guide and general requirements for the lab. You are expected to work on a **single** scenario from the [catalogue of scenarios](./Scenarios/ReadMe.md) developed for the [***StarTED*** database](./Database/ReadMe.md). Your instructor will provide information on how to determine your specific scenario. Each scenario revolves around generating two fully-functional forms:

* CRUD – Single item Create/Read/Update/Delete.
* Query – GridView Lookup with ObjectDataSource controls.

Your instructor will provide any additional information on submitting/demonstrating the lab.

## The Deliverables

This project is divided into several deliverables, outlined below. ~~Your instructor may require that you present one or more deliverables **in-class** in order to gain the marks for that deliverable.~~ The due dates for each deliverable are subject to change.

* [**Deliverable 1:** - 5 %](./Deliverable-1.md) –  Due **Apr 2, 2021**: End of week 12
  * Project Planning.
* [**Deliverable 2:** - 5 %](./Deliverable-2.md) – Due **Apr 7, 2021**: Middle of week 13
  * Initial solution setup with class libraries and web application including but not limited to: entities setup, database connection, appropriate references and navigation
* [**Deliverable 3:** - 5 %](./Deliverable-3.md) – Due **Apr 16, 2021**: End of week 14 
  * Query page.
* [**Deliverable 4:** - 20 %](./Deliverable-4.md)  – Due **Apr 21, 2021**: Middle of week 15
  * CRUD page.

> Each deliverable part is cumulative, building on previous deliverable parts of the solution. For each deliverable, any and all supporting functionality of previous deliverables must function correctly in order to gain marks for the demonstrated deliverable.
>
> ***Late labs or failure to demonstrate as required will receive a mark of zero for each affected part.***
